<h2>Work Experience</h2>

<p><strong>Testing and control lead Engineer</strong></p>

<p><em>Russian space systems, Moscow, Russia (March 2017 to Present)</em></p>

<p>Development of test equipment for automated testing of RF-devices, systems, etc. <br>
(with Python, NIvisa, PyVisa and Qt5)</p>

<p>Modeling (with Matlab, Simulink) and hardware implementation of DPD for space application<br>
TR modules that run on high order of digital modulations (such as 256-QAM, 32APSK) and wide<br>
signal bandwidth (symbol rate above 500 Msym/sec)</p>

<p>Standardization of ATE (Automated Test Equipment) and systems that used in testing space equipment.<br>
I have developed industry standard for ground-based test equipment that used for on-board equipment</p>

<p><strong>RF test develop Engineer</strong></p>

<p><em>Akmetron untill mid of 2016 (Keysight reseller), Sernia untill 2017 - Moscow (March 2014 to March 2017)</em></p>

<p>I developed automated test stands (ATE) for testing electronic devices and systems (RF devices up to 67 GHz,<br>
GNSS, Radar and telemetric systems, etc.) for Developmental, Approval and Acceptance tests </p>

<p>I gave a lot of technical presentations, demonstrations, seminars and trainings for<br>
technical specialists of our customers. I told how to use measurement equipment and perform measurements <br>
such as the noise factor, phase noise, S-parameters, wideband frequency response (from 1 GHz and higher),<br>
test communication standards, measure digital modulation parameters, mixers measurements, load-pull and etc.</p>

<p><strong>Research Engineer</strong></p>

<p><em>Russian space systems - Moscow (September 2011 to March 2014)</em></p>

<p>I developed and tested modules and prototypes of electronic equipment for space applications:<br>
designed and assembled PCBs, developed test plans, troubleshooting and measuring <br>
(testing, analysis, documentation, reports)</p>

<p>In addition, I participated in telemetry processing projects, DSP algorithms based on microcontrollers,<br>
FPGA, BMC and ASIC (Analog, digital designs and a lot of test benches for our projects even RTL modeling)</p>

<p>For example, I participated in develop Kanopus-V-IK satellites (http://tass.com/science/987982) when<br> 
I worked on capturing the signal, digital processing the signal, transport packing for transmission to the Earth.</p>

<h2>Education</h2>

<p><strong>Master&#39;s in Technology and design of radioelectronic facilities</strong></p>

<p><em>Moscow Aviation Institute (National Research University) - Moscow September 2007 to June 2013</em></p>
