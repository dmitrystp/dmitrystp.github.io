</ul>

<p>I have a strong background in the fields of hardware and software development, testing, signal processing, RF-measurements etc.</p>

<p>Familiarity with a lot of measurement and test equipment (DMMs, oscilloscopes, spectrum, time interval, logic and network analyzers, power meters, load-pull systems, ATE systems, etc.)</p>

<h2>Skills</h2>

<p>Python, Matplotlib, SciPy, C, C++, Qt, LabView, Firmware, measurement equipment, National Instruments, Automatic test equipment, Git, Microcontrollers, VHDL, Verilog, Autocad, Altium Designer, ASIC, Embedded, Matlab, Modeling, DSP, FPGA, ADS, IC-CAP, PCB designer, Soldering, Linux, ATE, Project Management, UML; Linux</p>

<h2>Work Experience</h2>

<p><strong>Testing and control lead Engineer</strong></p>

<p><em>Russian space systems, Moscow, Russia (March 2017 to Present)</em></p>

<p>Development of test benches for automated testing of RF-devices, telemetric systems etc (with Python, NIvisa, PyVisa and Qt5)</p>

<p>Modeling (with Matlab, Simulink) and hardware implementation of DPD for space application TR modules that run on high order digital modulations (such as 256-QAM, 32APSK) and wide signal bandwidth (symbol rate above 500 Msym/sec)</p>

<p>Standardization of ATE (Automated Test Equipment) systems used in testing space equipment. I have developed industry standard for ground-based test equipment that used for on-board equipment</p>

<p><strong>RF test develop Engineer</strong></p>

<p><em>Akmetron untill mid of 2016 (Keysight reseller), Sernia untill 2017 - Moscow (March 2014 to March 2017)</em></p>

<p>I developed automated test stands (ATE) mainly for microwave (RF) measurements up to 67 GHz for incoming and output inspections of products, control for compliance with technical specifications (GNSS, Communications, RADAR etc.)</p>

<p>I gave many technical presentations, demonstrations, seminars and trainings for the technical specialists of our customers. I told how to use the microwave measuring equipment and perform measurements such as the noise factor, phase noise, S-parameters, wideband frequency response (from 1 GHz and higher), test communication standards, measure digital modulation parameters, mixers measurements, load-pull and etc.</p>

<p><strong>Research Engineer</strong></p>

<p><em>Russian space systems - Moscow (September 2011 to March 2014)</em></p>

<p>I developed and tested modules and prototypes of electronic equipment for space applications: designed and assembled PCBs, developed test plans, troubleshooting and measuring (testing, analysis, documentation, reports)</p>

<p>In addition, I participated in telemetry processing projects, DSP algorithms based on microcontrollers, FPGA, BMC and ASIC (Analog, digital designs and a lot of test benches for our projects even RTL modeling)</p>

<p>For example, I participated in develop Kanopus-V-IK satellites (http://tass.com/science/987982) when I worked on capturing the signal, digital processing the signal, transport packing for transmission to the Earth.</p>

<h2>Education</h2>

<p><strong>Master&#39;s in Technology and design of radioelectronic facilities</strong></p>

<p><em>Moscow Aviation Institute (National Research University) - Moscow September 2007 to June 2013</em></p>
