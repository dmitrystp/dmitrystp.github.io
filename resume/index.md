# Dmitry Stepanov

### Development Engineer

*   Location: Los Angeles, CA
*   Willing to relocate: Anywhere
*   Contacts: dmitry_stepanov@list.ru

I have a strong background in the fields of hardware and software development, testing,  
signal processing, RF-measurements etc.

Familiarity with a lot of measurement and test equipment (DMMs, oscilloscopes, spectrum,  
time interval, logic and network analyzers, power meters, load-pull systems, ATE systems, etc.)

## Skills

Python, C, C++, Qt, VHDL, Verilog, FPGA, LabView, Modeling, Firmware, ASIC, DSP,  
Testing, Electronic space equipment, Embedded, Microcontrollers, Microelectronics, Git, UML,  
Linux, Autocad, Altium Designer, Matlab, ADS, IC-CAP, PCB designer, Soldering,  
Prototyping, Measurement equipment, Automatic test equipment, Matplotlib, SciPy, NIvisa,  
SQL, National Instruments, ATE, Project Management

## Work Experience

**Testing and control lead Engineer**

_Russian space systems, Moscow, Russia (March 2017 to Present)_

Development of test equipment for automated testing of RF-devices, systems, etc.  
(with Python, NIvisa, PyVisa and Qt5)

Modeling (with Matlab, Simulink) and hardware implementation of DPD for space application  
TR modules that run on high order of digital modulations (such as 256-QAM, 32APSK) and  
wide signal bandwidth (symbol rate above 500 Msym/sec)

Standardization of ATE (Automated Test Equipment) and systems that used in testing space  
equipment. I have developed industry standard for ground-based test equipment that is used  
for on-board equipment

**RF test develop Engineer**

_Akmetron untill mid of 2016 (Keysight reseller), Sernia untill 2017 - Moscow (March 2014 to March 2017)_

I developed automated test stands (ATE) for testing electronic devices and systems (RF devices  
up to 67 GHz, GNSS, Radar and telemetric systems, etc.) for Developmental, Approval and  
Acceptance tests

I gave a lot of technical presentations, demonstrations, seminars and trainings for  
technical specialists of our customers. I told how to use measurement equipment and perform  
measurements such as the noise factor, phase noise, S-parameters, wideband frequency response  
(from 1 GHz and higher), test communication standards, measure digital modulation  
parameters, mixers measurements, load-pull and etc.

**Research Engineer**

_Russian space systems - Moscow (September 2011 to March 2014)_

I developed and tested modules and prototypes of electronic equipment for space applications:  
designed and assembled PCBs, developed test plans, troubleshooting and measuring  
(testing, analysis, documentation, reports)

In addition, I participated in telemetry processing projects, DSP algorithms based on  
microcontrollers, FPGA, BMC and ASIC (Analog, digital designs and a lot of test benches for  
our projects even RTL modeling)

For example, I participated in develop Kanopus-V-IK satellites (http://tass.com/science/987982)  
when I worked on capturing the signal, digital processing the signal, transport  
packing for transmission to the Earth.

## Education

**Master's in Technology and design of radioelectronic facilities**

_Moscow Aviation Institute (National Research University) - Moscow September 2007 to June 2013_
