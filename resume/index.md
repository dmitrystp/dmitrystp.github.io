## Work Experience


**Lead Testing and Controls Engineer**

_Russian space systems, Moscow, Russia (March 2017 to Present)_

Developed system architecture and requirement for measurement systems of unified onboard equipment as a System engineer. Currently for 8+ unified systems and 40+ unified modules. 

Developed automated test equipment for a lot of RF-devices, different Space systems etc (with C/C++, Python, NIvisa, PyVisa and Qt5)

Modeling (with Matlab, Simulink) and hardware implementation of digital pre-distortion (DPD) for space application Transmit/Receive (T/R) Modules that run on high order of digital modulations (such as 256-QAM, 64APSK) and wide signal bandwidth (symbol rate above 500 Msym/sec)

Designed standard of Roscosmos Corporation for ground-based ATE (Automated Test Equipment) and test systems that used in testing of electronic on-board space equipment


**RF test develop Engineer**

_Akmetron untill mid of 2016 (Keysight reseller), Sernia untill 2017 - Moscow (March 2014 to March 2017)_

Developed automated test stands (ATE) for testing electronic devices and systems (RF devices up to 67 GHz, GNSS, Radar and telemetric systems, etc.) for Developmental, Approval and Acceptance tests

Demonstrated products and POC (Proof of Concept) development. Made a lot of technical presentations, demonstrations, seminars and trainings for technical specialists of Customers

Promoted measurement equipment and measurements methods such as the noise factor, phase noise, S-parameters, wideband frequency response (from 1 GHz and higher), test communication standards, measure digital modulation parameters, mixers measurements, load-pull, etc.

Managed projects for the sale, development and implementation of the company's measuring solutions to Customers


**Research Electrical Engineer**

_Russian space systems - Moscow (September 2011 to March 2014)_

Developed and tested modules and prototypes of electronic equipment for space applications: designed and assembled PCBs, developed test plans, troubleshooting and measuring (testing, analysis, documentation, reports)

Participated in telemetry processing projects, DSP algorithms based on microcontrollers, FPGA and ASIC (Analog, digital designs and a lot of test benches for our projects even RTL modeling)

Designed real-time embedded systems for Kanopus-V-IK satellites (http://tass.com/science/987982) namely for data acquisition system, capturing and digital signal processing, transport packing for transmission to the ground station.
